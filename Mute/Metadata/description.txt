If you do anything with audio on your Mac, you'll know the need to quickly mute and un-mute any connected audio input device. 

Mute is a simple software mute tool that you can leave running during these times - such as while recording a podcast - and use to quickly toggle the state or volume of audio input on your Mac.

Features:
* Quick mute/unmute. 
* Adjust input volume (0-100%).
* Dark mode support.
